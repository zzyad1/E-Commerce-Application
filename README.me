Hey there,
I'm happy to share my latest Project ECommerce Application at Route Academy in ASP.NET core course:
I've developed a ASP.NET Core Web API using a code-first approach, integrating modern tools and techniques to build a scalable and secure backend system.



1- Identity Framework for Authentication:

Integrated Identity Framework for user authentication and authorization, providing role-based access control. Admin-exclusive actions are restricted to authorized users only.



2- Authentication with JWT Tokens:

Implemented JWT token authentication for secure user authentication, ensuring data privacy and integrity. Users can securely log in and register with encrypted passwords.



3- Database Integration with MSSQL and Entity Framework Core:

Utilized MSSQL database and Entity Framework Core for seamless data storage and retrieval. Employed LINQ queries for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.



4- Layered Structure and Repository Pattern:

Organized the project into a layered structure (Onion Layer Architecture), separating concerns for better maintainability and scalability. Employed the repository pattern to abstract data access logic, promoting code reusability and testability.



5- DTOs for Data Transfer:

Used Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to transfer data between layers, ensuring clean and structured communication. DTOs help maintain a clear separation of concerns and prevent over-fetching of data.



6-Dependency Injection for Loose Coupling:

Leveraged ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection to achieve loose coupling and improve the testability and flexibility of the codebase.

7- Payment method :

I've seamlessly integrated Stripe as the payment gateway for the E-Commerce Application. Stripe offers a robust and secure platform for processing online payments, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free checkout experience for users.
